# Fluid

This is a project recording the results produced during the development process of a fluid engine.

## Particle System Examples

### Features
+ **Particle Emitter**

    emits particles from a single point in given direction, speed, and spreading angle.
+ **Particle System** 

    stores properties and states of particles including mass, radius, positions, velocities and forces.
+ **Physically-based Animation** 

    calculates the system's states based on factors like internal and external forces exerted on the particles, and updates the physical system per given time interval.
+ **Collider** 

    implements rigid body collider like the ground.

## Cloth Simulation (Mass Spring System)

### Features
+ **Mass Spring System**

    creates a grid of particles and links them with springs. The states of particles are updated based on Hooke's law.
